Soon:
1. add directory of data to cell information
2. add get data functions so you can just define a class and an experiment
   and pull out the epoch data, etc.
3. 


Eventually:
1. Make an "updateDatabase" function to add new lines to the old database
2. Make a set of methods that can be used to do things like:
    - show cells/number cells per spine
    - return cells & spines associated with certain experiments
    - hm
3. Turn cdb into a proper class
4. Would it be worth it to make this into a GUI?
5. NO! this is just to have a standardized method of retrieving data
